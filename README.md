## SmartCards, a Flashcard Application

**SmartCards** is a java based desktop app designed to make and use flashcards. There's no limit
to how many card decks you can make and how many cards in a deck itself. When reviewing, you can 
choose how long until you want to see the card again based off your comfort level with the card. 
Because of this, my app is intended to be used by university or college students that want an 
organized, and self-tailored flashcard app, but its simplicity allows anyone to use it! 

### Why I Made This Project ###
I made this project because I wanted to make a free, easy to use, and simple flashcard app. Many 
of today's popular flashcard apps are either online and require paid subscriptions, or have 
complicated interfaces and are tough for new users to use. Learning and memorizing doesn't have to
be hard, and I hope my app helps with it.
