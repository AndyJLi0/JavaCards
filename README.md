## JavaCards, a Flashcard Application

**JavaCards** is a java based desktop app designed to make and use flashcards. There's no limit
to how many card decks you can make and how many cards in a deck itself. When reviewing, you can 
choose to view the front or the back of the card first, tailoring to your own study. My app is 
intended to be used by university or college students that want an organized, and self-tailored
flashcard app, but because of its simplicity, **anyone can use it**!

### Why I Made This Project
I made this project because I wanted to make a free, easy to use, and simple flashcard app. Many 
of today's popular flashcard apps are either online and require paid subscriptions, or have 
complicated interfaces and are tough for new users to use. Learning and memorizing doesn't have to
be hard, and I hope my app helps with it.
